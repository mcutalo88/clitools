# clitools

## My personal collection of cli tools

This project is mostly for me to learn rust, while also yeilding
some useful tools that I could use.

### frequency
Takes stdin and count's the frequency of matching lines, the output is sorted from
greatest to least.
```
> echo "meow\nmeow\ncat" | frequency
2 meow
1 cat
```

### unique
Takes stdin and outputs all unique lines.
```
echo "meow\nmeow\ncat" | unique
cat
meow
```

### cslice
Takes stdin and outputs the column specified.
```
